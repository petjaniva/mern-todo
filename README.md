# mern-todo

A collaborative ToDo -app for organizations. Create a list of tasks for everyone in your organization to see and when they're done mark them done and everyone will know.

Written in Typescript with Node.js backend, Mongo Database, React frontend and TailwindCSS is used for style. Started from a youtube-tutorial, but collaborative aspect with socket.io and other further features are compeletely my own doing.
